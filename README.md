# How to do Airdrop:

As the name suggests, Airdrop means to send tokens to a group of eligible accounts, as in ATD airdrop all the EOS holder Registered accounts which were captured on Genisis Snapshot 2nd June, 2018. It is like Christmas gifts. But the Airdrops on EOS are not free for the sender company. it requires RAM, CPU and NET resources to make it free for the receivers but the sender Company pays for these resources, though they can get back their investment of CPU and NET right after Airdrop but the RAM is a complex part.

The Company purchases enough RAM (~32MB)  to do Airdrop and this RAM returns to them when the receivers make use of their tokens.

After you have created the tokens, you can now do Airdrop by either issuing the tokens to each account in the csv snapshot file or by transferring them.
First you need to read the csv file in an array and then you can put a loop and send tokens to each account in array.
